	<h1>Why I want to become a developer</h1>
	<p>I want to become a developer because I enjoy 
		solving real-world problems through technology.
		I love the logical thinking and creativity 
		involved in building software, and I find 
		satisfaction in turning ideas into working 
		applications. Being a developer allows me to 
		continuously learn, improve</p>
